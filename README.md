# Big-Data-Project

Project done by Dylan DO AMARAL, Marvin PAUL and Rémi BOUKHELOUA<br/>
The goal was to provide a simple Lambda architecture using Kafka, Spark, Spark Streaming and HDFS like system to store datas that have been simulated by a Python script.

Files:
- dataSimulation: Generate JSON File to simulate IOT Devices
- myProducer: Producer reading the JSON and sending JSON format messages to Kafka (beeData topic)
- scalaDataReader: Spark code reading files in the HDFakeSystem and performing simple analysis
- zeppelin: Spark Streaming module consumming datas in the Kafka's topic and creating realtime graphs 
- streamingConsumer: Spark Streaming module consumming datas in the Kafka's topic and sending alerts if certain levels such as low fuel devices are reached
- bashConsumer: Spark streaming consumming every x mn in order to exctract datas from Kafka and put them as csv in the HDFakeSystem
